In the process of building this website from the ground up, I acquired skills in various web development techniques that will be invaluable in future projects. Here's a rundown of the significant features and concepts implemented:

- **Responsive Hamburger Menu**: Designed for tablet-sized screens and smaller, enhancing mobile accessibility.
- **Smooth Scroll Functionality**: Ensures seamless navigation experience, with smooth scrolling enabled for all links in the header and footer.
- **Dynamic Animations with IntersectionObserver**: Implemented subtle animations based on viewport conditions (e.g., element visibility within the viewport).
- **Cross-Browser CSS Compatibility**: Applied vendor prefixes (-webkit, -moz-, -o-, -ms-) to ensure consistent styling across various browsers.
- **Browser & Device Testing**: Conducted extensive testing across different browsers and devices, with special attention to styling select inputs uniformly.
- **Interactive Contact Form**: Crafted a functional and engaging contact form to enhance user interaction.
- **Media Query-Driven Responsiveness**: Ensured that the website adapts elegantly across different device sizes using media queries.
- **Advanced CSS Techniques**: Employed a mix of grid, flexbox, and absolute positioning to achieve the desired layout and design.
